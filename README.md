# Commit Messages (in Pull Request) Checker with regex

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/axe007/commit-message-checker?style=flat-square)
![Test](https://github.com/gsactions/commit-message-checker/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)

A GitHub action that checks that commit messages match a regex pattern. The
action is able to act on pull request and push events and check the pull
request title and body or the commit message of the commits of a push.

On pull requests the title and body are concatenated delimited by two line
breaks.

Designed to be very flexible in usage: you can split checks into various
workflows, using action types on pull request to listen on, define branches
for pushes etc. etc.

## Configuration

More information about `pattern` and `flags` can be found in the
[JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).

`flags` is optional and defaults to `gm`.

### Example Workflow

  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
      - synchronize

jobs:

          pattern: '^.{0,75}(\n.*)*$'
          error: 'Subject too long (max 75)'

      - name: Check Body Line Length

        with:
          commits: ${{ steps.get-pr-commits.outputs.commits }}

          error: 'Body line too long (max 72)'

      - name: Check Fixes

          pattern: '\s*Fixes\s*:?\s*(#\d+|github\.com\/kata-containers\/[a-z-.]*#\d+)'
          error: 'No "Fixes" found'
          one_pass_all_pass: 'true'

      - name: Check subsystem
        if: ${{ success() || failure() }}
        uses: tim-actions/commit-message-checker-with-regex@v0.3.1
        with:
          commits: ${{ steps.get-pr-commits.outputs.commits }}
